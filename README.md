# TOM online management

Based on the popular [MEAN.JS](http://meanjs.org) Stack.

This will allow you to manage players and in the future tournoments with a much nicer inerface.

The main goal of this project is to make large tournoments easier to manage, TOM is a pain to deal with. When you have many judges and a 100+ player event, you have to all have one main instance of TOM that has all players and all with one machine, everyone dislikes this. This give the abillity to have anyone at any time to enter in player info and allow any judge to get the player list in a format TOM can read.
